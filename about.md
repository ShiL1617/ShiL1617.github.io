## Welcome to my portfolio web page! This web page is under construction, so please stay tuned for updates as I make progress on cool/meaningful projects.

My degree and coursework say I'm a materials scientist. Yet, my research experience and interests define me as a device engineer. I've been mostly happy working at the intersection of the two fields, but things changed when I was a Masters' student at Penn. The computer vision course there revitalized my interest in programming, made me ponder how areas such as medical imaging could be transformed, and introduced me to the possibility of what robotics could do.

Coupled with my past experience working with wearable medical devices, I started to wonder how robotics could impact human-machine interfaces. To this end, I'm looking forward to learning all I can, and hopefully establish a career, in medical robotics.
