## Overview

(figure from Nature CommunicationsÂ 5, 4938 (2014).)

This project demonstrates, for the first time, a class of wearable
medical devices with integrated thermochromic liquid crystals (TLC's)
with radio frequency (RF) antennas that, when coupled with pattern
extraction algorithms, provide quantitative measurements of transient
thermal characteristics of the skin. We use this platform to measure
skin hydration and blood flow and discuss its utility in health diagnostics
related to the skin and heart.

My responsibilities on this project were device fabrication, optimizing
the process flow (making substrate transfer more reproducible), and
device characterization/measurements (IR readings, mechanical
characterization).
