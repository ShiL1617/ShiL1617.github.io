## Overview
This was my custom implementation of the Canny edge detection algorithm,
for the Computer Vision and Computational Photography course I took Fall
2015 at the University of Pennsylvania.

We had followed the approach outlined in the original paper, but were
given freedom on how to implement the various sections, such as image
filtering and edge linking hysteresis.
