## Overview

(figure from R. Sutton and A. Barto: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction)

This is the final project for EECS 433: Statistical Pattern Recognition.

I am working with a partner to study and implement various reinforcement
learning algorithms in the context of target tracking and shooting.

Please come back for future updates.
