## Overview
Using Baxter's grasping, vision, and path planning capabilities, we programmed Baxter to place a fork, knife,
and spoon (each color-coded), to a specific position relative to a plate. This was a group final project for
ME 495: Embedded Sytems in Robotics at Northwestern University.

I was involved in: writing the master node, measurements/calibrations for parameters in inverse kinematics, and experiments
to allow for more robust HSV image processing.

commented code for this project.
