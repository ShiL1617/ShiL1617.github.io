## Overview

Here are three projects I implemented for the Computer Vision and Computational Photography course I took Fall 2015 at the University of Pennsylvania.

Canny Edge Detection

This was my custom implementation of the Canny edge detection algorithm,
for the Computer Vision and Computational Photography course I took Fall
2015 at the University of Pennsylvania.

We had followed the approach outlined in the original paper, but were
given freedom on how to implement the various steps within the algorithm.
I had taken different approaches to image filtering and edge linking
hysteresis, which greatly assisted in detection of low-frequency edges.
