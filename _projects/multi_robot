## Overview

In this project, I am seeking to simulate multiple wheeled robots (differential drive) to exhibit classical swarm robotics behaviors
such as leader-follower formation.

I am concurrently building real robots to validate my simulations.

This project is a work in progress, please come back for future updates.
