## Overview

(above figure from Adv. Mater. 2013, 25, 2773-2778)

This project was an extension of a previous work on epidermal electronics
devices for biomedical diagnostics applications. A distinct advantage
of this class of device is that it matches the mechanical properties of
human skin, facilitating comfortable wear and usage without impediment
of the user's daily activities.

We seek to improve the utility of the previous work by introducing
multiple functionalities beyond the previous work, allowing for more
durability and environmental robustness, and easier usage/initial
application.

My main responsibilities in this project were device fabrication and testing.
I was also responsible for experimental design, and quantitative characterization, of the mechanical properties of the encapsulant materials
used in the device. I was also peripherally involved in device component
design.
